# go-bird_bgp_exporter
BGP session state exporter for bird routing daemon to use with Prometheus

# Remarks
this is an early version of the exporter. So there is no customisation possible at the moment. I will implement flags to change e.g ports in a later version.

# Prometheus
see https://prometheus.io/

# Bird routing daemon
